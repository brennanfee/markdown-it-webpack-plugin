# Second heading for file 2

Nothing too interesting here. Although ~~most~~ some of the GitHub extensions should be working.

By default, GitHub style table rendering and strikethrough should be on.

| First Header | Second Header |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Content      | Other content |
| Stagger      | Is ok         |
| Last row     |               |
