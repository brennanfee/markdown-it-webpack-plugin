# This is a heading

Some paragraph text with some **bold** info and some _italic_ info.

This second paragraph is testing something about line breaks? It seems as though any newlines within
a paragraph can produce a break tag rather than the newline. At present this option is turned off so
we should see the natural line breaks and no break tags.

One option is to allow outputting of markup so <span id="test">this phrase</span> should be within a span.

Another option should be the "automatic" conversion of quotes to typographic versions.

Another option is to convert normal urls like https://www.google.com to a link without them having to be rendered in markups link syntax.
